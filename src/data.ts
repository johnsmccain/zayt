In 2021, we established a private, not-for-profit school dedicated to supporting orphans in low-income communities. Our goal is to grant access to quality education for these children, starting with 10% of our total school enrollment annually in the first five years, with the aim to increase this to 50% in the next ten years. All enrolled orphans are provided with school uniforms and necessary supplies to support their studies, ensuring they have the tools they need to succeed.",
